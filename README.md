# Hearing Aid Lipo Charger
 
##Motivation

My brother suffers from twice-ruptured eardrums. As a result, he has lost a significant portion of his hearing and recently has purchased a hearing aid to help with this. The hearing aid that he had purchased had some oversights regarding the mechanical and electrical design. My brother and I took it upon ourselves to fix the problem by adding an circuitry and redesigning the enclosure to accomadate it.

##Overview

The main problems with the design were:

### a) The wireless charging case contained no battery, and thus had to be plugged into the wall. Essentially rendering the case more of a docking station. This proved to be quite useless for my brother, who takes his hearing aids on the go.

### b) The mechanical design of the case did not enclose the hearing aids, and the hearing aids were not magnetized to the case. This made it so that the hearing aids fell out of the case constantly. 

We aimed to remedy both of these problems by designing a PCB that would provide regulated 5V output from a 3.7V Lithium Polymer battery, as well as allow the user to charge the battery via a standard micro USB cable. This PCB was designed to plug directly into the micro USB port of the PCB that was already included in the case.

The case was completely redesigned to accomodate the new PCB and its various features, including an RGB LED indicator and an ON/OFF switch.
